Arrays of integers 𝑨 and 𝑩 have the same size, 𝒏. 
There's a new definition called "weird equality": two arrays 𝑨 and 𝑩 are weirdly equal to each other if at
least one of the following four conditions is met:

1) 𝑨 = 𝑩, meaning that the elements in the corresponding indices are the same.
   If 𝒏 is divisible by 2, we divide each of the arrays into 2 parts of equal size. So, 𝑨 will be divided into 𝑨𝟏 and 𝑨𝟐 (from
   left to right). Similarly, 𝑩 is divided into 𝑩𝟏 and 𝑩𝟐. Now, the following conditions are checked and if any of them are
   satisfied we can still say that the arrays are weirdly equal to each other.
   
2) (𝑨𝟏 is weird equal to 𝑩𝟏) AND (𝑨𝟐 is weird equal to𝑩𝟐)

3) (𝑨𝟏 is weird equal to 𝑩𝟏) AND (𝑨𝟏 is weird equal to 𝑩𝟐)

4) (𝑨𝟐 is weird equal to 𝑩𝟐) AND (𝑨𝟐 is weird equal to 𝑩𝟏)

Note: if 𝒏 is not divisible by 2, then conditions 2, 3, and 4 are NOT satisfied.

Input Format
  The first line has an integer 𝟏 ≤ 𝒏 ≤ 𝟏𝟎𝟒. The second line has the 𝒏 integers, 𝒂𝟏, 𝒂𝟐, ... , 𝒂𝒏−𝟏, of array 𝑨, and the third
  line has the 𝒏 integers, 𝒃𝟏, 𝒃𝟐, ... , 𝒃𝒏−𝟏, of array 𝑩, where 𝟎 ≤ 𝒂𝒊, 𝒃𝒊 ≤ 𝟏𝟎𝟖, for each 𝟎 ≤ 𝒊 ≤ 𝒏 − 𝟏.
  
Output Format
  On one line print "YES" if the arrays are weird equal to each other, and "NO" if they are not. This output is case-
  sensitive and the quotes are just for clarity.
  
The solution is written as a recursive program that correctly and efficiently reports the solution. The runtime is 𝑇(𝑛) ∈ 𝑂(𝑛2) time.
